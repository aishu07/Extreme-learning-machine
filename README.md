Project Overview:

This project implements a Diabetes Monitoring System that leverages an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and integrates it within a cloud environment to enhance the efficiency of diabetes prediction. The system uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection and performs classification using the ELM algorithm. The overall objective is to provide an automated solution for early diabetes detection, especially catering to rural areas where healthcare facilities might be limited.

Features
Diabetes Prediction:
Uses machine learning to predict diabetes based on input features.
Cloud Integration: Deploys the model on a cloud platform for scalable and remote access.
PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces data complexity by selecting the most significant features.
ELM for Classification: Utilizes a single-layer feedforward neural network for fast and efficient classification.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score.
Components

Python Script (elm.py): Contains the implementation of the ELM algorithm, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Setup Instructions:
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
